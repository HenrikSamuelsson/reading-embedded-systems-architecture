# Notes

This is a test project where all the code was and the linker script was generated by ChatGPT.

Command to build this project in a Windows cmd prompt:

```cmd
arm-none-eabi-gcc -mcpu=cortex-m4 -mthumb -Wall -O0 -T linker.ld -nostdlib -Wl,--gc-sections main.c startup.c -o blinky.elf
```

Run the command from within the same filder where the code is located. Expected result is that a `blinky.elf` files appears in the folder.
